# HyperonMC-analysis
This repo contains scripts, config files and program to analyse Monte Carlo productions of Hyperon-M experiment @ U70 accelerator.
Scripts are used to start analysis at IHEP Collective Computing Cluster (http://clc.ihep.su) using torque batch system.
Analysis program 6gam_prog is old-fashioned Fortran piece of art in terms of long lifetime)) It is used to analyze data (real and Monte Carlo) of Hyperon-M experiment and produces HBOOK and ROOT histograms with different kinematic distributions of recorded events.
